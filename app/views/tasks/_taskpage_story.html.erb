    <h2>Your Story</h2>
    <p>"Story is everything. Let me back up. Your story is everything. People aren't so much getting behind the idea as they are getting behind your passion to produce it... It HAS to have heart,"says Nathaniel Hansen, an indie filmmaker who has raised over $350,000 on Kickstarter to date. People aren't going to give you money because you think it would be cool to get paid to make a movie or design a magazine. You need to convince people with a purpose, a larger vision, or -- at the very least -- a lot of passion. Explain why the world needs your project now.</p>
